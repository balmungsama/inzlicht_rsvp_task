#Each bin descriptor contains three lines.
#The first line gives the bin number;
#the bins must be listed in ascending order starting with bin 1 (not with bin 0, as in ERPSS).
#The second line gives a written description of the bin, which will be used for things like labeling waveforms when the data are plotted.
#The third line provides the criteria for determining whether a given event should be assigned to that bin.  It is conventional, but not necessary, to place a blank line between the end of one bin descriptors and the beginning of the next.
#Note that comments can be included if preceded by a # character.

#Sequences of events. Let's begin by considering the criteria for the first bin, "{101;102}.{100}{t<200-1000>202}". Each set of curly brackets ("{}") defines an event. The event following the dot is the time-locking event, and the preceding and following sets of curly brackets define the events that must precede and follow the time-locking event. In this example, the string ".{100}" indicates that the time-locking event for this bin must have an event code of 100. Multiple event codes can be listed by separating individual event code values with semicolons. Thus, the string "{101;102}.{100}" indicates that the time-locking event code 100 must be immediately preceded by either a 101 or a 102.
bin 1
correct
{11;12}.{15}
bin 2
incorrect
{11;12}.{16}
